      <p>
      Hello, I'm Dana Alami and I'm a gradute from the University of Manchester with an undegradute hons degree in Business and Management with Italian Language. 
      I'm taking a coding course and diving into the web development world as I've been interested by it for some time and wanted to challenge myself with something new to learn.

I was born and raised in Jerusalem, Palestine and went to Manchester to study. I spent a year abroad in Bergamo, Italy as part of my course to expand my knowledge in Italian history and culture. 
I would love to get a job in Manchester and move there as I fell in love with the city and its people.
